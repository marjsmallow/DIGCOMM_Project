1 CONSPECTUS
	1.1 What are the objectives of the coursework?
		1.1.1 To assess any Diital Communications Technolog (DCT)
		to be used in marginalized sector.
		1.1.2 To modify the DCT appropriate to selected marginalized
		sector.
		1.1.3 The researchers should be able to restrict the area of the
		one hundred random points using the 3d area of a ”bowl”.
		1.1.4 To appraise the economic, societal, and environmental
		implications of the modified DCT.
	1.2 How does the coursework fit with the course and
	previously done coursework?
		1.2.1 This project focuses on notifying the app users immediately
		when panic button is pressed.
		1.2.2 It involves the creation of a communication platform
		between caregivers and the elderly in case of emergencies.
	1.3 How were the objectives achieved?
		1.3.1 The target marginalized sector of our DCT is the elderly
		1.3.2 Additional mode of addressing an emergency (via app)
		will be implemented instead of just having a buzzer when a panic
		button is pressed
