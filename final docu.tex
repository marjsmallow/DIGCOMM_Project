\section{Results and Discussions}

\subsection{How do the results achieve the objectives?}
By:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Showing that TDMA was more efficient compared to CDMA. With this, the modified DCT would highly benefit the marginalized sector.
	\item Proving that TDM and FDM overlays protocol are beneficial to helping the device to be able to connect to more than one data connection to other devices simultaneously
	\item Knowing that using bluetooth modules with modified DCT is better than using other modules such as GSM/GPRS because the marginalized sectors are able to get more benefits with less expenses.

\subsection{Why do the results achieve the objectives?}
Because:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The marginalized sector will consume less on the device due to the cheaper module that will be used 
	
	\item Bluetooth is less harmful to the environment since
	it does not release any ionizing radiation compared
	to other modules like GSM or GPRS
	
	\item The project device overall is societal for its objective is to prevent harm that may be inflicted by rape victims.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Are all you results correct  in accordance to what you described in Sec.~\ref{sec:eval} evaluation process? Why?} 
Yes, because:

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

\subsection{What are the main points that should be known, remembered, and learned about the coursework?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The multiple access of Bluetooth, from CDMA to TDMA, could be modified to have a better performance.
	\item Bluetooth could be modified in such a way that it could connect to multiple data connection simultaneously by implementing TDM and FDM overlays
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What are the gists of the inferences drawn from your results?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Replacing the original GSM module to Bluetooth module is an acknowledgeable procedure due to its economical, societal, and environmental benefits.
	\item With the use of CDMA and TDMA performance measurements exhibit that the degradation can be to the inverse of third or fourth order, making the proper selection of a desired receiver threshold even more important than with a conventional FM two-way radio modeling.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Briefly, what are your comments on (1)~your results, and  (2)~future coursework if any?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The results show that TDMA is remarkably better than that off CDMA because a single frequency can support multiple, simultaneous data channels.
	\item To create a working hardware model of the implemented codes above
