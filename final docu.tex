\section{Methodology}

\subsection{How does your implementation in Sec.~\ref{sec:implem} achieve the objectives?}
By:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Simulating the performance difference between CDMA and TDMA.
	\item Showing application of TDM and full full duplex transmission to panic button device.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Why does your implementation in Sec.~\ref{sec:implem} achieve the objectives?}
Because:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The application of TDMA simplifies the point to multiple-point connections
	
	\item Multiple-point connections can help the rape victim reach out to a lot of contacts simultaneously
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How does your evaluation in Sec.~\ref{sec:eval} achieve the objectives?}
By:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Achieving these results, it can be proven that the use of overlay TDM into FSHH would improve its duplexing technique.
	\item it would make the panic button device more efficient and faster for reaching help since multiple contacts are accessed simultaneously.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Why does your evaluation in Sec.~\ref{sec:eval}  achieve the objectives?}
Because:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	It is proven that a possibility of simultaneous access point is possible with bluetooth through simulation
	
	\item It could serve as new innovation to further studies about multiple access with bluetooth.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results and Discussions}

\subsection{How do the results achieve the objectives?}
By:

	\item Showing that TDM and FDM overlays protocol are beneficial to helping the device to be able to connect to more than one data connection to other devices simultaneously;
	\item From the aforementioned statement, it showed that using bluetooth modules with modified DCT, is better than using other modules such as GSM/GPRS because the marginalized sectors are able to get more with less expenses.
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Why do the results achieve the objectives?}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Up to two lines per item.

\subsection{Are all you results correct  in accordance to what you described in Sec.~\ref{sec:eval} evaluation process? Why?} 
Yes/no, because:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Up to two lines per item.
	\item Up to two lines per item.

\subsection{What is result $X$ (briefly describe it here), what does it mean if it is correct, and how does it contribute in reaching the objectives?}
\label{sec:resn}

\begin{enumerate}		
	\item Refer to the appropriate caption number  of your result, i.e. Fig.~$X$ for figure $X$, Table~$X$ for table $X$, etc.	
	\item Interpret result $X$ and the reasons why it was obtained. 
	
	\item Point out and explain apparent discrepancies from principles/concepts/theory if your result is incorrect.
	
	\item Cite existing publication for comparison of your result.
	
	\item Do not present your result as ``It worked'' without an appropriate explanation as such action does not show thorough understanding.
	
	
	\item Repeat Sec.~\ref{sec:resn} for each major result $X$ (i.e. $X$=1, $X$=2, etc.).		
\end{enumerate}

For example, result $X = 1$ (on the accuracy performance of the enhanced bi-directive method):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Figure \ldots shows that the performance of the system is satisfactory up to 90\%.
	\item The result in Figure \ldots was obtained because of the bi-directive mechanism of the proposed architecture.
	\item The remaining 10\% accuracy loss is due to the failure of the bi-directive mechanism to \ldots and supported by \ldots.
	\item Reference~\cite{Einstein1905} also achieved similar range of results from 85\% to 93\%.
